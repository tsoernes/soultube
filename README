## How to run
Provided that museek and dependencies are installed (see below).
First, start museek daemon: 'museekd &'
Then, to download a music file, run for example: `./soultube --ad "dire straits telegraph road"`


## Install
First, install museek with its python-bindings and mucipher.

Museek is abandoned so installing will be troublesome.
If you run into trouble during the install you might find fixes in some of museek's forks:
https://github.com/eLvErDe/museek-plus/network


Install Museek dependencies (for Fedora 26, will vary by distro):
libxml++-devel
qt-devel
swig
libevent-devel
python-devel
redhat-rpm-config


Fix known Museek bugs:
(ref: https://github.com/eLvErDe/museek-plus/issues/26)
replace museek-plus/searches.cpp and museek-plus/chatrooms.cpp
in the museek-plus source code directories with the corresponsing files
from this repo


Install (in museek-plus directory):
cmake .
sudo make install


Install python bindings (in museek-plus directory):
cd python-bindings
sudo python setup.py install


Install pymucipher (in museek-plus directory):
cd Mucipher/PyMuciper
sudo python setup.py install


Configure museek:
Either set the variables: server, username, password, interface password, download dir
by running 'musetup'
or setting the variables manually in the file '~/.museekd/config.xml'.

Remember to share some music, or else you will often get permanently queued when downloading.
Sharing folders can be done in either 'musetup' or 'muscan'.


Configure soultube:
Run soultube once (any parameter) so that a default config is created,
then set interface password in the file '~/.museekd/soultube.config'.
Here you can configure how soultube connects to the museekd daemon and 
file selection heuristics.
